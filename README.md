# New-Project
# Big Picture 
this project is designed for quadratic function calculation, and it will use Pygame to create the graphics of this programm. In order to use Pygame as part of the project, I want to create a programm that shows a calculator that has different functions.

# First Step
For the first round I am looking to first create the graphics of this program and focus mainly on quadratic functions that was already done in the last part of the projet.

# TEST PLAN
In order to check if my program is working, the users can type in equations that they already know the number of solutions and to check if the result from my program. I suggest testing the program at least with three different equations.

# Reflection and Revision
For this round of the project I am still just counting the amount of sotions that these equations have. It is not yet very close to a real calculator. I think in order for me to finish this project, I need to learn more about the mathematic functions in python in order to complete this program. 
# Next Steps
My next step of this project would still be on quadratic formular. However, instead of just counting the amount of solutions that one has. I will be looking to find the actual result for more practical uses.
