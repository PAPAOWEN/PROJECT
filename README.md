#this project is designed for quadratic function calculation, and it will use Pygame to create the graphics of this programm.
In order to use Pygame as part of the project, I want to create a programm that shows a calculator that has different functions.

#For the first round I am looking to first create the graphics of this program and focus mainly on quadratic functions that was already done in the last part of the projet.

#TEST PLAN
#In order for the users to check if this program is working they can type in the constants for the equation and compare the results of my program to that of the actually value that a calculator would've given(though it'd waaaaaay slower than the program.)
#For example the user can type in 3x^2+4x-1=4, and solve this on their calculator. By comparing the results, it would prove my program works.
#Just in case on any coincidence, the user should try at least 3 different equations in order to get a wider range of evidence so they won't be using the wrong values.
