# New-Project
# Big Picture 
The goal of the project is to create a digital calculator that includes some basic operations such as solving the quadratic equations. This project will use pygame to create the user interface, and will use the interface to show the results of the calculations basing on the user's input.
# First Step
For the first round I am looking to first create the graphics of this program and focus mainly on quadratic functions that was already done in the last part of the projet.

# TEST PLAN
In order to check if my program is working, the users can type in equations that they already know the number of solutions and to check if the result from my program. I suggest testing the program at least with three different equations.
